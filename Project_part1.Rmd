In this project you will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. We investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials of a thousand simulations.


```{r}
set.seed(10302)
sim_exp_means = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) sim_exp_means = c(sim_exp_means, mean(rexp(40, 0.2)))
```


```{r}
hist(sim_exp_means)
abline(v=mean(sim_exp_means),col="red")
abline(v=5.0,col="green")
```

```{r}
sim_exp_mean <- mean(sim_exp_means)
sim_exp_mean
```
The average of mean value from my simulation is 4.990325. The theoretical mean value is 1/gamma, i.e. 5 here. 

```{r}
set.seed(10302)
sim_exp_vars = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) sim_exp_vars = c(sim_exp_vars, var(rexp(40, 0.2)))
hist(sim_exp_vars)
mean(sim_exp_vars)
```
The average of variations is 24.96423, the theoretical varience is 1/gamma^2, 25.
